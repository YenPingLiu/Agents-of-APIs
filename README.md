# Agents-of-APIs
Our MARVELous app to geek out on your favorite Marvel characters!

## Concept
We decided to create an app with the Marvel API as inspiration. Our app allows you to choose a superhero from a list of Marvel Characters that you would like to know more about. After your selection, you are given information on recent comic book depictions, feature motion pictures, and related discussions of the character on Reddit to bolster your knowledge.

## Motivation
Comic book characters are an enjoyable and fun topic with a dedicated fanbase and have been a huge inspiration for entire franchises of movies in the last 20 years. We thought it would be a good idea to bridge the worlds of comics, movies, and current news/discussions into one reference site.

## Our Design Process
Our team began our project by dividing the important tasks, simultaneously designing the UI and researching APIs. Once we had a basic UI and knew what each of our featured APIs could offer, we began integrating the two...and voila!

## Technologies Used
 * HTML/CSS
 * JavaScript
   * JQuery
   * Parallax
   * Smooth scrolling
 * Marvel API
 * OMdB API
 * Reddit API
 * Firebase
 
## Future Development
The sky is the limit! We had some initial brainstorms about integrating a buyer/seller API such as Ebay to cater to collector's items and general fan memorabilia. More animation and special effects could also compliment our theme and the excitement of the page.

Since the chosen APIs will occasionally return undesireable results (e.g., Non-Marvel content with similar names), there is an oppurtunity for further data validation of the returned JSON responses.
